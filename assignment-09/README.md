1. I feel like Im getting to understand html more. For the most part erverything is repetative with each website. What I have difficulty with is getting the words to get to be the font size I want. I also want to understand how to place things specifically on the page whether that be in the center, to the left, or to the right. I realy enjoy changing the background and add boxes to the page.

For the most part I'm excited for the new section. I only about the coding getting complicated and getting lost. I think if I study the content I will grasp it.
