    Missouri river
</div>
<br/>
<div id="riverinfo">
    From the origins of the Missouri at Three Forks to Canyon Ferry Lake, 
    The Missouri becomes a trophy trout fishery in the fall when monster browns 
    and even some rainbows run out of the lake below. This is one of the best places
     to have a shot at 23-30" trout during October. In the summer the Townsend stretch 
     produces some of the world's best fly fishing for carp. Don't knock it unless you 
     have tried it! We site fish for the carp on large river flats, it is almost exactly 
     like bonefishing the flats (except the carp average 10-15lbs!).

    Madison river
</div>
<br/>
<div id="riverinfo">
    The Madison River offers an amazing diversity of
     water and can vary significantly in its character 
     as it travels on its course from Yellowstone National
      Park to the Missouri River. Different sections of the river 
      offer different habitat, scenery, hatches and fishing 
      techniques. In many ways the Madison feels like a completely 
      different river from one location to the next. The variety along 
      this legendary fishery is one of the many factors that makes it 
      one of the most consistent rivers in Montana. Although different 
      sections of the river have their own peak fishing times, there is
       almost always a location on the Madison that is fishing well nearly 
       every month of the year. The Madison truly offers some of the most
        diverse and consistent fly fishing in Montana.

    Smith River
</div>
<br/>

<div id="riverinfo">
    Montana's Smith River is one of the West's legendary fly fishing trips. 
    The river winds through 60 miles of wilderness between
     public access points and is strictly regulated by Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks 
     to ensure the pristine beauty of the canyon is not overrun. The river corridor is 
     comprised of towering limestone cliffs and heavily timbered forests broken only by a few small 
     clusters of cabins on private land.  Because of the strict permit system, fishing pressure on 
     the Smith is much lighter than on other major Montana rivers.  Both Rainbows and Browns
      are present in good numbers, and fish over 20" are taken on virtually every trip. 
       Floating and fishing on the Smith generally takes place in May, June, early July and September. 
        Late July and August are generally too low for floating.  There is typically enough water to float 
        again in the fall after irrigation season ends and fall rains help to raise the river.

    Yellowstone river
</div>
<br/>
<div id="riverinfo">
    The Yellowstone River is the longest free flowing river in the lower 48 and one of North America’s
     most productive wild trout fisheries. This large river drains much of Yellowstone National Park 
     and its surrounding wilderness areas. The mighty “Stone” offers more than 200 miles of high 
     quality trout waters that include a variety of fish species and water characteristics. 
     Many avid anglers consider this big and sometimes brawling freestone river to be the quintessential
      Montana fly fishing experience.
